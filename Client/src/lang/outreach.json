    "description": "We are grateful for those around us and thankful for our achievements. A huge part of showing our gratitude is by giving back to our community. Here in Dulles Robotics, we plan and organize many outreach activities to make sure those around us grow with us too. Helping others has become a reflex action and we are delighted to be a helping hand! We have taken our CAD skills to make 3-D printed masks in times when hospitals were running out due to COVID. Our members have donated to victims of Hurricane Laura to help those in need. We will continue to reach out and create a friendly atmosphere where ever we go."

    "description": "Dulles Robotics strives to take the knowledge we learn and spread it to others. Our goal is to allow everyone, regardless of age, gender, and race, to have the opportunity to learn about the STEM field. It is crucial for the younger generation to learn about the STEM pathway as it is growing in popularity and it is what will build our future. We have held many camps, workshops, and events allowing kids to learn about programming languages like Java, Python, and HTML and CAD software like Autodesk Inventor and Fusion. We host meetings for colleges to come speak about what robotics is like beyond high school so people have a plan for the future. Along with technical knowledge, we strive to spread values of FIRST such as gracious professionalism, gratitude, and resilience."
