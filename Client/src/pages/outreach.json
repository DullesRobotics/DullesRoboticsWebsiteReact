    "description": "Dulles Robotics was founded in August 2016 by three Dulles HS students with a passion for STEM and teaching. Since then, the club has had a tremendous impact on its students, the school and the community. Composed of a group of diverse, focused, and fun-loving individuals, Dulles Robotics has become more than a club, but a family. <br/> <br/> Every year, our club continues to grow. What started as 15 students has grown to over over 50 today. Our club consists of students from all backgrounds all joined under similar interests.",
